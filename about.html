                    <p>My name is Andrew McNutt and this is a story all about how My life got flipped-turned upside down and I'd like to take a minute, just sit right there I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel Air. In west Philadelphia born and raised On the playground was where I spent most of my days chillin' out, maxin', relaxin', all cool and all shootin some b-ball outside of the school when a couple of guys who were up to no good started making trouble in my neighborhood. I got in one little fight and my mom got scared. She said 'You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel Air'. I begged and pleaded with her day after day but she packed my suit case and sent me on my way. She gave me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket, I put my Walkman on and said, 'I might as well kick it'. First class, yo this is bad drinking orange juice out of a champagne glass. Is this what the people of Bel-Air living like? Hmm, this might be alright. But wait I hear they're prissy, bourgeois, all that Is this the type of place that they just send this cool cat? I don't think so I'll see when I get there I hope they're prepared for the prince of Bel-Air Well, the plane landed and when I came out There was a dude who looked like a cop standing there with my name out I ain't trying to get arrested yet I just got here I sprang with the quickness like lightning, disappeared I whistled for a cab and when it came near The license plate said fresh and it had dice in the mirror If anything I could say that this cab was rare But I thought 'Nah, forget it' - 'Yo, homes to Bel Air' I pulled up to the house about seven or eigth And I yelled to the cabbie 'Yo homes smell ya later' I looked at my kingdom I was finally there To sit on my throne as the Prince of Bel Air.
