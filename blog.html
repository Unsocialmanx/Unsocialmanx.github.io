			<h2>Hike 1: Twin Falls Trail-Washington State</h2>
			<h4><i>Today I ran into a wonderful woman about half way up the trail who shared a small breakfast with me at 
			the top of the trail. A family of deer came down to drink at the falls during this time.</i></h4>
			<p1><b>The trail overall was pleasant.</b> It wasn't close to any major human activity and the sounds of the local wildlife
			could be heard from about 3 minutes into the hike until reaching the same point on the way down. The trail itself was 
			well maintained and appeared to have a focus on leaving as little man-made impact on the area. </p1>

			<h2>Hike 2: Wallace Falls-Washington State</h2>
			<h4><i>Amazing trail with a good sized river to help provide the perfect</i></h4>
			<p>
			<b>The waterfalls along the trail are absolutely stunning.</b> Nothing is quite able to beat the beaty and amount
			of bright, vibrant green along this trail. Moss surrounds you on all sides while old, dead trees that have fallen
			provide life to a variety of plant matter and fungus while simultaniously providing homes for the woodland creatures.

			<h2>Climb 1: The Black Cliffs-Idaho</h2>
			<h4><i>A new personal bests for lead climbing on a sport route and overall the hardest route I've ever completed! Though I'm still exhausted
			from the six hours of climbing but from the time we got there until the time we left there was nothing but beautiful skies and perfect rock
			conditions.</i></h4>
			<p>
    			<b>The unique beauty of Idaho never ceases to amaze me!</b> Nothing quite like getting back to home and revisiting the local crag. After years
			of hard work and trying to get better and better at climbing, I was finally able to complete one of my long term goals i set in the beginning
			of my days climbing, the route Perception vs Reality on the Populace Wall. I couldn't be happier to have the greatest day of climbing that
			I've ever had with my brother.

			<h2>Climb 2: Mores Mountain-Idaho</h2>
			<h4><i>My first time climbing some serious slab with my brother.</i></h4>
			<p>
			<b>I've always looked at slab climbing and thought that it couldn't be that hard.</b> Hell it isn't even straight vertical and so it simply
			had to be easier. Evidently I was very very wrong. Using mainly your feet with the hope you don't fall and bash your teeth into the rock.
			It was the first time I've ever consistently used a thumb press on a tiny piece of quartz or trust all of my weight to it. An awesome and
			somewhat scary day but boy was it a blast.
